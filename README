silverline-demos
A demo rails app showing off the capabilities of the silverline plugin.

= What is Silverline?

Silverline is a Ruby on Rails plugin which gives the ability to run Ruby in 
the browser to manipulate HTML or vector graphics. Having Ruby code run in 
the browser elevates client programming in Rails to be first-class, and 
integrated with the rest of the framework.
